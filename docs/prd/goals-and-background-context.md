# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
*   **Cost Reduction:** Reduce database costs for multi-project developers (~$20/mo for a VPS vs ~$300/mo in SaaS).
*   **High Availability:** Guarantee 99.9% uptime for connected applications via robust architecture (PgBouncer).
*   **Instant Provisioning:** Achieve a "Time-to-Project" of < 5 seconds for provisioning a new database.
*   **AI Autonomy:** Ensure total autonomy for AI Agents: ability to initialize and modify structure (Tables + Data) via API without human intervention.
*   **Hybrid Experience:** Merge the "Premium" user experience (Visual Dashboard) with an "AI-Native" architecture (Swagger, Admin API).

### Background Context
Independent developers and creators using AI Agents are currently stuck between the prohibitive cost of SaaS solutions like Supabase (billed per project) and the complexity of managing self-hosting on a VPS. Furthermore, existing tools are not optimized for interactions with AI Agents (lack of standardized API documentation, programmatic migration difficulties).

Branch solves this problem by offering a "Self-Hosted Database as a Service" stack deployable on a single VPS. It offers a modern management interface for humans and a standardized API for AI, thus combining data sovereignty, economies of scale, and advanced automation.
