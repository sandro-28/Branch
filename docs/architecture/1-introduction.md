# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Branch**, including backend systems (Docker infrastructure, PostgREST), frontend implementation (Next.js Console), and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for this "Infrastructure-as-Code" application where these concerns are intrinsically linked.

### 1.1 Starter Template or Existing Project
**Status:** N/A - Greenfield project.
**Context:** The project will be initialized as a Monorepo from scratch, incorporating a standard Next.js 14 setup for the Console and a Docker Compose based infrastructure for the backend services, as defined in the PRD.
